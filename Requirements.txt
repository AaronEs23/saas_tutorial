Stripe Integration
* Users should have a stripe customer token in the users table.
* JS should prevent PRO form from submitting, when user fills it out,
  and should send card info to stripe. Stripe returns a card token.
* JS should send user fields and card token to rails app. Rails app
  should validate user fields. Rails app will note whether plan 1 or 2.
* Once validated, rails should send user info and card token to Stripe server
  and stripe will create a subscription and send back customer token.
* Rails should save customer token and user info to our database.
